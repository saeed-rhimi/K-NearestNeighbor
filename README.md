# K-Nearest Neighbor Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for a classification task using the "Social_Network_Ads.csv" dataset. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used is "Social_Network_Ads.csv", focusing on social network advertisement data. The goal is to classify data points based on the features provided.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/K-NearestNeighbor.git
cd K-NearestNeighbor
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to go through the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The notebook is well-commented, making it easy to follow along and understand the implementation details.

## Understanding the KNN Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, yet effective classification method. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. This project uses the KNN algorithm with specific parameters to achieve classification.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score. These metrics provide insight into the model's effectiveness.

## Visualization
The notebook includes visualization of the training and test results, helping in understanding the model's performance visually.
